## ⚙️ Hey, I’m Shedrack Erhabor  
A developer from South Warri, Nigeria — learning in public, building thoughtfully, and staying grounded.

> “From South Warri. Learning, building, and trying to leave things better than I found them.”

## 🛠️ What I Work On  

I build practical, maintainable systems—whether for mobile, backend, or low-level environments—with growing interest in decentralized tech and secure architectures.

- **📱 Cross-Platform Mobile**: Flutter (with clean architecture, Riverpod, Firebase)  
- **🌐 Advanced Backend**: Scalable monoliths, event-driven systems, and resilient APIs — not just microservices  
- **🧱 Systems Programming**: C, C++, and Rust (exploring memory safety, concurrency, and performance)  
- **⛓️ Blockchain**: Writing and testing smart contracts in Solidity (Ethereum & EVM-compatible chains)  
- **🐍 Scripting & AI**: Python for automation, data pipelines, and lightweight ML/AI experiments  
- **🛡️ Security Mindset**: Privacy-first design, encryption, and defensive coding practices  

> I’m still learning deeply in each area—no claims of expertise, just consistent effort.

## 🌱 My Approach  

I believe software should solve real problems—not just look impressive on a resume.  
I focus on:
- **Clarity over cleverness**
- **Sustainability over speed**
- **Understanding over trends**

> “Build something useful. Learn from it. Repeat.”
