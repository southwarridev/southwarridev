## ⚙️ Hey, I’m Shedrack Erhabor  
A developer from South Warri, Nigeria — building thoughtfully, learning daily, and staying grounded.

## 🛠️ What I Work On  

I focus on creating reliable, purposeful software—whether for mobile, backend systems, or emerging tech—always prioritizing clarity and real-world impact.

- **📱 Cross-Platform Mobile**: Flutter (with clean architecture, Riverpod, and Firebase)  
- **🌐 Advanced Backend**: Building beyond microservices—working on event-driven systems, scalable APIs, and resilient data flows  
- **🧱 Systems & Performance**: C, C++, and Rust (learning memory safety, concurrency, and low-level design)  
- **⛓️ Blockchain**: Writing and testing smart contracts in Solidity (Ethereum & EVM-compatible chains)  
- **🐍 Scripting & AI**: Python for automation, data tasks, and lightweight AI integrations  
- **🛡️ Security & Privacy**: Applying defense-in-depth principles and secure-by-default patterns  

> I’m still deepening my understanding in each area—no pretense of expertise, just honest effort.

## 🌱 My Approach  

I believe good software serves people, not trends.  
My daily practice leans on:
- **Simplicity over complexity**
- **Careful design over quick fixes**
- **Long-term maintainability over short-term hype**

> “Build something useful. Learn from it. Repeat.”
